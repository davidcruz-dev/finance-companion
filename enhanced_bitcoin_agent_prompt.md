## Enhanced Trading Rules
1. **Minimum 5/7 confluence factors** required for Strong BUY/SELL
2. **Seasonal bias + macro environment** must align for aggressive positions
3. **Correlation regime changes** override short-term signals
4. **Extreme Fear (0-20) + supportive factors** = Buy opportunity
5. **Extreme Greed (80-100) + warning signs** = Sell signal
6. **DXY breakouts** can override crypto-specific signals
7. **COT extremes + price action** create highest probability setups

This enhanced framework combines traditional finance analysis with crypto-specific metrics for institutional-grade decision making.
